<!-- Usage -->
# Disable a warehouse
By default, all placement are enabled.<br/>
To disable a location, go into `cfx_gn_warehouses/stream/placement`, and remove the folder with the associated number.<br/><br/>
Note: *To easily keep a backup, you suggest you to create a `disabled` folder beside the stream folder and store the location in it. Then you can put it back to enable it later.*
