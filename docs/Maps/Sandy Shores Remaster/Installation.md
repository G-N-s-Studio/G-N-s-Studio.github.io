# Installation  

Sandy Shores has been developed over several years/months and is divided into multiple resources.  
This has no impact on your in-game performance; on the contrary, the way it is divided optimizes the overall weight of G&N's Studio resources.  

---

## Solution 1 - Easy Installation  

1. [Download the "**Sandy Shores Remaster - Vol1**" folder here](https://mega.nz/folder/CYYDwSaD#Bm3hMzSUJYAZKrCqyiYEUg)  
   <img src="/img/mega_sandy_easyinstall.webp" alt="Map with numbers displayed" />  
2. Create a `[GnStudio]` folder in your resources directory.  
3. Drag and drop all downloaded resources into the `[GnStudio]` folder.  
4. Start the `[GnStudio]` folder in your `server.cfg`:  
```yaml
    # G&N's Studio - Maps
    ensure [GnStudio]
```

## Solution 2 - Manual Installation  

1. Download all listed resources from your Keymaster/CFX Portal.  
2. Create a `[GnStudio]` folder in your resources directory.  
3. Drag and drop all downloaded resources into the `[GnStudio]` folder.  
4. Start the `[GnStudio]` folder in your `server.cfg`.  

```yaml
    #G&N's Studio - Maps
    ensure [GnStudio]
```
